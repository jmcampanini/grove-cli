Coding Preferences
==================

- When creating or modifying struct definitions, prefer sorting grouped fields in alpha order
- Prefer table-driven tests when applicable for testing multiple input/output combinations
- Run `make check` to validate that changes work correctly
- Shell scripts in `internal/shell/scripts/` must use shell-specific syntax (e.g., fish syntax differs from bash/zsh)
